            <p id="p2para">Hello! I'm a first-year engineering student at Newton School of Technology in Pune, specializing in AI and ML. I have a deep passion for technology and problem-solving, which has led me to explore various areas like coding, data structures, algorithms, and Linux-based projects.

                I am actively working on improving my programming skills, particularly in Python, and am focused on developing a strong foundation in logical reasoning and mathematics, which are crucial for solving complex coding problems. My goal is to secure a top-tier placement in Worlds top MNC's and eventually build a career that allows me to contribute to groundbreaking projects in AI and ML.
                
                <br> <br> In addition to academics, I have a variety of interests, including visiting Japan, skydiving, and learning scuba diving. I also have a keen interest in improving my English communication skills and sharing my knowledge with others through projects and tutorials.
                
                I believe in continuous growth and am always looking for new challenges to enhance my learning experience. Feel free to connect with me!
